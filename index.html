                The concept of hot air balloon came out as a product of curiosity among human beings, considering the
                dilemma whether a balloon big enough in size can lift people to transport them. Ever since people began
                their journey of finding ways to fly in the air, hot air ballooning came out as an intriguing concept
                which later became quite successful.

                People started using the means to transport themselves across narrow ocean beds, like the English
                Channel as well. In contemporary times, we find people availing balloon safari for recreational
                purposes. The concept serves its purpose well and people enjoy this calm activity which provides them
                breath-taking sights that they would never forget.
